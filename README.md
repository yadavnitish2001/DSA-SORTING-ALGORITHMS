# Sorting Algorithms

This repository contains implementations of various sorting algorithms in different programming languages. Each algorithm is implemented with detailed explanations and comments for educational purposes.

## Algorithms Included

1. **Bubble Sort**: Simple sorting algorithm that repeatedly steps through the list, compares adjacent elements, and swaps them if they are in the wrong order.

2. **Selection Sort**: In-place comparison sorting algorithm that divides the input list into a sorted and an unsorted region.

3. **Insertion Sort**: Sorting algorithm that builds the final sorted array one item at a time by iteratively selecting and inserting the minimum element.

4. **Merge Sort**: Divide-and-conquer algorithm that recursively divides the input array into smaller subarrays, sorts them, and then merges them.

5. **Quick Sort**: Divide-and-conquer algorithm that partitions the array into two subarrays and then recursively sorts each subarray.

## Usage

Each algorithm is implemented in [programming language] and can be found in its respective directory. Follow the instructions in each directory to run the implementations.

Feel free to contribute by optimizing existing code, providing implementations in additional programming languages, or adding new sorting algorithms.
